# Tutorial on how to setup and host it for COMPLETELY FREE!

## ⚠️This tutorial is for render, HOWEVER, render is SUPER unstable, it is recommended to run on your pc! ⚠️
## 1. Get your rolimons token. 
You can do this by going to inspect element > application > cookies > _Roliverification OR easier way is just downloading editthiscookie from https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg and getting the _Roliverification ![image](https://github.com/ArachnidRB/rolimons-trade-ad/assets/89037932/0885d0c5-afbb-4f85-ae9e-e9a9223a6d9b)
## 2. Create a github account.
## 3. Fork this respritory ![image](https://github.com/ArachnidRB/rolimons-trade-ad/assets/89037932/d7714391-8e91-4fac-a137-39753200572d)
## 4. Navigate to config.json
in YOUR respritory and adjust your config. You must be in edit mode. Also remember to save and commit changes
## 5. Go to https://render.com/
make an account. I signed up with google so it might be different. Create a new "Web Service" ![image](https://github.com/ArachnidRB/rolimons-trade-ad/assets/89037932/7658ad53-d15b-4692-a00f-df1e6d8c1405)
## 6. Connect your Github
Clicking the previous will make you connect your github profile. Do that and let it read SPECIFIC respritories ![image](https://github.com/ArachnidRB/rolimons-trade-ad/assets/89037932/0ac83443-c9b0-4a20-a73e-88b3908e8370) After doing this click on the forked github you did and connect on the render page
## 7. Configuring Server
Name does not matter, name it anything. Change the language to NODE. Branch should remain at main or forked. Region does not matter, but i reccommend USA. Leave root directory blank build command stays as yarn and start command should be node index.js. Now you also have to chose Free version for instance type ![image](https://github.com/ArachnidRB/rolimons-trade-ad/assets/89037932/115178da-eb36-48d6-883f-5a697f8dcc89) ![image](https://github.com/ArachnidRB/rolimons-trade-ad/assets/89037932/6cf9368c-0821-497d-a4d1-b7215afcca1a) For Environmental variables put "robloxId" and "token" as variable names. For the value you put the _Roliverification token you got earlier and your robloxId. THESE ARE BOTH IMPORTANT! ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/035cad9a-f874-428c-98ca-02b488c8c82f)


## 8 Add on uptimerobot (optional, recommend)
Make an acc here https://uptimerobot.com/login and add the url that is generated on your render.com page to uptimerobot. This will just make sure your bot stays up. This is optional as render.com hsa good uptime ![image](https://github.com/ArachnidRB/rolimons-trade-ad/assets/89037932/26f96b38-e95b-4fbb-a3b7-674cdedd08b7)

# PLEASE NOTE! DO NOT ABUSE ROLIMONS ADS! I made this open source to make it easier for traders and not ruin the value site! By doing this, you not only make it harder for yourself at trading but also make it harder for everyone else and can ruin trade quality. Rolimon is generous and allows trade ad bots, but if this becomes abusive he may start banning. Respect the site and respect free products :).
